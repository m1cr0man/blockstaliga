# Blockstalgia - A Modpack for Returning Players

Bring back the fun of playing a voxel sandbox without the boringness
of knowing how every mod works.

This pack is for players who once upon a time played Technic or other
tech packs, and want to get back into the game. There is a huge variety
of mods in here, although you may not recognise many of them.
